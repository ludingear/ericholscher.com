Arguing for Inclusivity
=======================

Large changes often start with small things.
Those small things are often not done because they are small.
Changing language is a small thing,
but it has a large impact.

When you change language,
there is a debate about why the change needs to be made.
Folks argue that if you aren't offended,
you shouldn't change it.
There is a call of "political correctness",
saying that the change is unnecessary.

If we are trying to build inclusive and welcoming communities,
"not offensive" isn't enough.
**Language should pass the test of "is it welcoming to everyone".**

Framing the questions in this way makes decisions a lot easier.
If we hope to change our community for the better,
we have to start holding ourselves to a higher standard.
