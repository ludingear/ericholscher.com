Musings on the Programming Community
====================================

As I write this,
I am on a couch in Vancouver, BC.
I am staying with a fellow Python Programmer who I had never met,
previous to staying here.
After taking a train from Portland with 30 other programmers on the CascadiaJS Hacker Train.

The excuse that I have for even visiting Vancouver is to attend a VanPyDay,
an open source community event.

Community
---------

I have been talking with folks that I stayed with about Community.
They are new to the open source world in the past couple years,
so they still view the community with fresh eyes.
Coming from an academic background,
they are impressed with the pervasive helpfulness and cooperation in the tech world.
In academia,
research data is kept secret,
and sharing with a person from another university seems crazy.

In academia they are all competing for the same grants, 
and same journals.
In programming,
we are all trying to solve the same problems.
We compete at a level above the tools,
with products.

I believe that the main difference is that in academia,
you are trying to discover something that already exists.
In programming,
you are trying to create something new.
The act of building is an inherently more cooperative effort than discover.
By definition only one person can discover something.

Meandering in the Woods
-----------------------

The programming community is better than lots of other communities.
That doesn't mean it doesn't have some problems though.

Earlier this year,
I hiked 800 miles of the Pacific Crest Trail.
Hikers have their own community,
and it is a very supportive one.
Everyone is in it together,
trying to walk across the United States.

If you are in the wilderness,
three days from civilization.
If someone needs something that you have,
it is a no-brained to give it to them.
This sense of comradery builds over time,
and you become a very tight knit community. 

Re-entering the programming community was hard for me after my hike.
The PCT community was so purposeful and supportive,
and the programming community wasn't.
There are lots of petty fights,
and people who talk poorly of other peoples work.

I think there are still so many unique and valuable things in the programming community to appreciate.
It's a worldwide group of people who are trying to make the world better.
They are releasing all of their work online for free,
for anyone to read and learn from.

It's easy to focus on the negatives and forget about the vast number of positives.
Getting bogged down on the few negative interactions,
when the entire system is a fascinating experiment.

Conclusion
----------

My entire professional and social world have been vastly improved by my interaction with programmer communities.
They are a unique and special part of the open source movement,
and something that we need to appreciate.
You should spend some time thinking about how much your community has done for you.
If you,
like me,
have been greatly helped by your community,
you should consider giving back somehow.

Whether by helping plan an event,
give money to people on Gittip,
or submitting patches,
you should do your part to make your community better.
