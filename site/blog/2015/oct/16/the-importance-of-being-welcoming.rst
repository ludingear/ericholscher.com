The Importance of Being Welcoming
=================================

Conferences have been a fundamental part of me becoming a professional developer.
Having a network of people you know personally in a professional context is a huge advantage.
It helps getting jobs,
they help you think through problems,
and it's important to help you identity as a member of the community.

There's a problem though.
It can be hard to integrate into these groups when you first show up.
Even with a huge amount of conference experience,
going to new events with new communities is nerve racking.

A few years ago,
I learned a really important thing that conference organizers can do to make this easier.

Encouraging Courage
-------------------

The hardest part for me is walking up to a group of people that I don't know,
or that I do know, and respect.
I will generally default to sitting by myself or staring at my phone,
instead of joining a conversation that would likely be quite interesting.

This all changed at `XOXO <http://2012.xoxofest.com/>`_.
In the opening address,
they **explicitly gave me permission to join and interrupt groups of people**.

This turned the interaction model on it's head.
I now boldly joined new groups,
knowing that it was my job at the conference to do this.
As a *proper* conference attendee,
it was encouraged and expected of me.

As a member of a group chatting,
it also made it much easier to welcome someone into the conversation.
**It set the tone and expected behavior for everyone at the event.**

3 + 1 = <3

Similar to a Code of Conduct,
giving people permission to act in ways that makes the conference more valuable is a fundamental role of the organizer.

I now `do this <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmjF1PZxuHs&feature=youtu.be&t=3m19s>`_ at every conference I organize.
Telling people how to act,
and giving them permission to interact,
fundamentally changes the conference experience.
