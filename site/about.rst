About me
========

I currently call Portland, Oregon home. I lived in the woods for over 2 months while walking 800 miles of the Pacific Crest Trail in 2013.

I have previously lived in Lawrence, Kansas for 2.5 years from May 2008-Dec 2010. I lived the rest of my life in Virginia, migrating from the Shennendoah Valley, to Virginia Beach for high school, then to Fredericksburg for college.

I've previously worked at these awesome companies:

    * Urban Airship
    * Lawrence Journal-World
