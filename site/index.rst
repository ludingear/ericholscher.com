Welcome to the home of Eric Holscher on the web. 

I talk about software development, mostly in the realm of Django. I am interested in the web, testing, mobile apps, documentation, and much more.

I currently live in Portland, Oregon, and love to explore the outdoors.
Whether on bike or foot, I spend as much time as possible out and about,
checking out the various beauty that the world holds.
